Code Strucutre

    main_optimisation:
        Function
        -This is the main script that should be run.
        -Outputs the optimum arrangmenet or launchpads in terms of how many launchpads should be used and the distribution of drones between them.
        -Will show a visual representation of the current optimum that is being calculated.

        Variables
        -The locations and populations of the hospitals can be changed by modifying the H array
        -The investement and cost of launchpads/drones can also be changed in the settings section

        Run Time
        -In current configuration 15 min
        -Run time varies depending on costings and array H

        Calls
        -draw map from drone_blood_delivery_map_drawing
        -runOptimiser from optimiserEvolution



    optimiserEvolution:
        Function
        -This script is responsible for setting up the differential evolution optimiser
        -Defines boundaries for main_optimisation
        -Contains function runOptimiser which returns the optimal locations of x number of launchpads and the corresponding utility value

        Variables
        -No values should be changed in this script

        Run Time
        -Aproximately 1 -5 minutes
        -Depends on size of array H and number of launchpads

        Calls
        -objF from objectiveFunction

    

    objectiveFunction:
        Function
        -Defines the complete objective function which returns the utility value to be minimised

        Variables
        -Change r the vary the maximum drone range in km
        -Change q to vary how utility is effected by distance between launchpad and hospital
        -change b to vary the drone benefit factor which is how many people each drone can sufficiently cater for

        Run Time
        -<1s

        Calls
        -None



    tuningObjectiveFunction:
        Function
        -Used for tuning the objective function and observing patterns for when only one launchpad is used.
        -Evaluates objective function for just one launchpad at points in a grid within the boundaries of the map, x,y cordinates are location of 
        launchpad.
        -Displays the gradient of colours which depend on utility value at each point

        Variables
        -change sF to vary the sample interval. an sF of 1 will sample every km which is 1000*1000 points.

        Run Time
        - Proportional to (1/sF)^2
        - The smaller the sample interval the longer it takes to run
        -Aproximately 15s for sF value of 10

        Calls
        -draw map from drone_blood_delivery_map_drawing
        -objF from objectiveFunction

    

    drone_blood_delivery_map_drawing:
        Function
        -Used for displaying visual representation of map, hospitals and locations of launchpads being built
        -Can be used to display heatmap based on evaluation of utility value in array of x,y values
        -Main function is drawMap which can be provided with different arguments to change what is drawn 
        -If a utility value is supplied it will be displayed in the top left of the screen
        -If an objVals array is provided a gradient of colours will be dran depending on the utility value at each point

        Variables
        -No values should be changed in this script

        Run Time
        - 0<run time <60s
        -Depends on arguments provided
        -Takes up to 60s if drawing gradient

        Calls
        -None
